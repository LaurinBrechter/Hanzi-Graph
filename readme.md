# Main ideas


- represent mandarin words/characters as an undirected graph.
- nodes are characters (morphemes)
- there is an edge between 2 nodes if they appear together in a word.
- showing all words/characters is definitely too much.



# Functionalities


- Search for Hanzi Character
- Search for Words
- filter by HSK Level
- filter by word length
- filter by usage level (stars)
- radical search
- when searching for a specific hanzi character, ability to show the word of the characters where the query character is a part of.



# Important

- Graph must be unambiguous.

# Ideas

- work width node components
